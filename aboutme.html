            Shyam Singha Roy is a 2021 Indian Telugu-language period romantic drama film directed by Rahul Sankrityan from a story written by Janga Satyadev. 
            The film stars Nani in a dual role alongside Sai Pallavi, Krithi Shetty and Madonna Sebastian. 
            It is partly set in the backdrop of Kolkata in the 1970â€™s and it is based on the theme of reincarnation.
            I like the movie because, i am super connected to that story
